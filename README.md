<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I am currently pursuing my Bachelors of Engineering under the domain of Computer Science Engineering from National Institute of Technology Sikkim. I am passionate about my work. Because I love what I do, I have a steady source of motivation that drives me forward. I am also an upbeat, ambitious, self-motivated team player and driven person with proven leadership capabilities, who likes to take initiative and seek out new challenges. I thrive on challenges and constantly set goals for myself. So I have something to strive forward and achieve in my life. I am always looking for an opportunity to do better and achieve greatness.
Being a Sophomore , I am still learning and therefore need an opportunity to inhance my Skills.Though I am new, I can vouch for the fact that I am a fast learner with a penchant to both learn and unlearn,(i.e) learning the latest relevant skills. I also bring with me some fresh ideas. I will strive to add maximum value to the people around me - in terms of my eagerness to learn, dedication and strong work ethic</p>
